"If the mouse travels fewer than this number of pixels between polling "

"The number of milliseconds hoverIntent waits between reading/comparing mouse "
"coordinates. When the user's mouse first enters the element its coordinates "
"are recorded. The soonest the \"over\" function can be called is after a "
"single polling interval. Setting the polling interval higher will increase "
"the delay before the first possible \"over\" call, but also increases the "
"time to the next point of comparison."

"A simple delay, in milliseconds, before the \"out\" function is called. If "
"the user mouses back over the element before the timeout has expired the "
"\"out\" function will not be called (nor will the \"over\" function be "
"called). This is primarily to protect against sloppy/human mousing "
"trajectories that temporarily (and unintentionally) take the user off of the "
"target element... giving them time to return."
